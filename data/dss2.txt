Range: 5 yards per level
Components: V, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None
Material Component: String or cord tied in a knot.

by distorting the air waves that project the voice and dispersing them.
This interrupts any spell casting requiring verbal components.
Hand of the Sorcerer-Kings (Summoning)
Sphere: Cosmos
Range: Self
Components: V
Duration: 1 turn + 1 round per level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: Self
Saving Throw: NA
When a templar casts this spell, he is immediately protected from
magical spells cast against him. The shimmering field that surrounds
him acts to diffuse magical energy, giving the templar a +2
save vs. all spells of magic users, be they defilers or preservers.
Only templars may use this spell.
Spark of Blinding (Conjuration)
Sphere: Elemental Sun
Range: 15 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1-4 rounds
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 10 foot radius
Saving Throw: None
Material Component: Sunlight
This spell causes a brilliant but tiny spark of light to flash before a
targets eyes, blinding him for 1-4 rounds. During that time, the
victim fights as if blinded, and makes all saving throws at 2. A
successful save will negate this effect The priest may only cast this
spell above ground and in the presence of the sun.
2nd-Level Spells
Altruism (Invocation)
Sphere: Cosmos
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: NA
With this spell, a cleric may transfer hit points to another character
or being of any alignment not directly opposed to his own
(good vs. evil or lawful vs. chaotic.) Hit points are exchanged on a
1 to 1 basis, and may not be taken back once the spell has been
cast. The recipient of the spell cannot gain more hit points than
he normally has, and cannot refuse the gift even if he wants to.
Black Cairn (Divination)
Sphere: Cosmos
Range: 1 mile radius per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 hour
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: NA
Material Component: 5 smooth black stones
After this spell is cast, the caster knows the location of any corpse
(animal or otherwise). The priest must first find the stones, each
one bigger than a fist. He stacks them in a small pile, or cairn, and
sits and stares at the blackness of the stones until he receives a
vision of the corpses location. If the caster has an item belonging
to the target, the casting time is reduced by half. Templars and
druids may cast this spell, elemental and paraelemental clerics
may not.
Channel Stench (Summoning)
Sphere: Elemental Air
Range: 0
Components: V, S
Duration: 3 rounds
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 10 foot cube
Saving Throw: Special
The priest draws in a deep breath and expels it toward his opponent.
All noxious odors from up to two miles away are channeled
through the clerics breath and ejected in a vile cone of stench.
All breathing creatures within the cone must make a saving throw
vs. poison. Those who fail must retreat and gag for 1-6 rounds;
those who succeed will fight at 1 for 1-6 rounds due to teared eyes
and labored breathing. Strong winds or a source of fresh air will
cut this in half. Those with more than 5 Hit Dice or higher than
5th level may ignore channel stench.
Clues of Ash (Divination)
Sphere: Elemental Fire
Range: 0
Components: S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 10 foot radius per level
Saving Throw: NA
Casting this spell on a pile of ashes will give the caster a smoky
vision of the scene before the item or creature was destroyed. The
vision starts from the time the thing was ruined or killed back to 1
round per level. A 4th-level priest would see the last four minutes
of its existence. Clues of ash will also tell the caster whether the
thing was an item or a living creature, and whether it was
destroyed by fire or by defiling magic.
If vegetable matter destroyed by defiling magic is being tested,
there is a 10% chance that the priest will be able to identify the
spell that destroyed it.
Coat of Mist (Summoning)
Sphere: Elemental Air, Water, or Rain
Range: 0
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: Self
Saving Throw: NA
A priest can use this spell to coalesce a magical mist about him.
The mist lowers his armor class by 2, and gives him a +2 saving
throw vs. any sun or fire based attacks. The spell can only be used
at night, during a rainstorm, or any other time natural mists might
be present. These modifiers are cumulative with any others the
priest might have, except further castings of coat of mist.
Create Mirage (Illusion)
Sphere: Elemental Sun
Range: 60 yards + 10 yards per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Time of Concentration
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 400 cubic feet
Saving Throw: Special
Material Component: Sunlight
Under the heat of the sun, a priest can cause an illusory image
exactly like the 1st-level wizard spell phantasmal force. The exception
is that the mirage will instantly disappear if touched.
Reversing this spell reveals things as they really are, negating
any mirages or illusions.
Crystallize (Alteration)
Sphere: Elemental Water
Range: 30 yards
Components: V, S
Duration: Until the ice melts
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 5 inch radius per level
Saving Throw: NA
This spell turns 1 cubic foot of water per level of the caster into
ice, or forms a 1 inch thick layer of ice over any existing pool.
Many of the people and creatures of Athas have never seen ice,
and may consider it a treasure, even if told it will only last for a
short time. Of course, the cleric doesnt have to tell them the ice
will melt. Also effective against water beasts. Anyone walking on
a patch of ice must make a save vs. paralyzation to remain standing.
If failed, the victim spends the round trying to stand up.
Might of the Sorcerer-Kings (Summoning)
Sphere: Cosmos
Range: Touch
Components: V
Duration: 5 rounds + 1 per level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: NA
Another spell developed by the sorcerer-kings empowers minions
with unnatural aggressiveness in times of need. Templars will fight
at a +2 to their attacks and a +2 to damage while under the influence
of this spell. They will lose 1 hit point after the spell ends. Hit
points can be regained normally, a side effect of the spells frenzy.
Slave Scent (Divination)
Sphere: Elemental Air
Range: 10 yards
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 person
Saving Throw: None
When this spell is cast, the priest can use scent, to discover
whether a person is a freeman, slave, escaped slave, or noble. Templars
use this spell to detect escaped slaves. If an air cleric finds a
slave by using this spell, elemental air spirits will demand that he
free the person.
Speak with Water (Divination)
Sphere: Elemental Water
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 question per level
Casting Time: 4 round
Area of Effect: Body of water
Saving Throw: NA
Water, or the spirits that dwell within it, can speak to casters of this
spell. It will know such things as what creatures drank from it last
and what they looked like, where a particular fish is, or if a specific
item lies at the bottom. It has no concept of names or time, and generally
only remembers events that have occurred in the past week.
This is a good way of finding out how long a given water supply
will last, or if it has been enchanted or poisoned. The caster must
be able to see the water to speak with it.
Steal Breathe (Evocation)
Sphere: Elemental Air
Range: 120 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 3 rounds
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None
Material Component: A braided length of cat hair.
This spell forces the air out of an opponents lungs. It causes him
to lose one round of action and suffer a 3 initiative modifier for
the next three rounds. The reverse of this spell is deep breathe,
found in the Dragon Kings source book. Nonbreathing creatures
are unaffected by this spell. Steal breathe can be used to disrupt
spellcasting.
Water Witch (Divination)
Sphere: Elemental Water
Range: Special
Components: V, M
Duration: Until water is found
Casting Time: 1/2 hour
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: NA
Material Component: 2 Metal or wooden rods
The cleric must first find two metal or wooden rods no more than 2
feet long and 1/8 inch thick. He holds one in each hand, level with
the body, and begins to walk When water is detected, the rods will
be attracted to each other and form an X over the spot. The sticks
are only magical for the duration of the spell, and the caster is guaranteed
to find 2d6 gallons of water no more than 1 foot below the
ground. The water will be muddy, so each thirsty adventurer will
have to consume twice the amount he would normally need.
Whispers (Summoning)
Sphere: Elemental Air
Range: Sight
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Time of Concentration
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
Material Component: Clerics holy symbol
The whispers spell allows a priest to overhear anything said by any
individual he can see. The caster must focus his attention on one
creature at a time, but can shift it instantlyto keep up with a
conversation, for example. Because the sounds are actually carried
on the wind between the priest and his target, the caster may
not use scrying or other spells for the purpose of seeing.
3rd-Level Spells
Bramblestaff (Alteration)
Sphere: Elemental Earth or Water
Range: 0
Components: S, M
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: NA
This spell causes an ordinary wooden staff or club to sprout thick,
extremely hard spikes on one end, just like a staff made from
bramblewood. The staff does double damage for the duration of
the spell, and adds +2 to the casters attack roll. A bramblestaff
made in this way can affect any creature that can be harmed only
by magical weapons.
Circle of Life (Alteration)
Sphere: Elemental Water
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 day
Casting Time: 4 rounds
Area of Effect: 3 creatures per level
Saving Throw: NA
Material Component: Clerics holy symbol
This very valuable spell enables the caster and a number of creatures
of equal or superior levels to survive in inhospitable terrains.
Those affected by the spell need only half their water requirements
per day, and regain 1 extra hit point every 24 hours.
The spell does not help the caster in any way, in fact, he will
require twice the amount of water he normally needs. This is
because the priest transfers his own bodily water to those within
the circle of life, and the constant drain needs to be replenished.
Conjure Lesser Elemental (Conjuration/Summoning)
Sphere: Elemental (All)
Range: 30 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 turn + 1 round per level of the caster
Casting Time: 3 rounds
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special
Material Component: Handful of the proper element
With this spell a priest may freely summon a lesser elemental from
his own elemental sphere. The creature will do anything within its
power to aid the caster. A priest cannot summon an elemental
from an opposing sphere. Only clerics and druids can cast this
spell; templars cannot conjure lesser elementals.
Once cast, there is a 50% chance for one to three 2 Hit Die
elementals to appear, a 25% chance that one 6 Hit Die elemental
will appear. The lesser elementals can be sent back by the caster,
one at a time or all at once, at any time. They automatically return
to their home plane after the duration of the spell. Conjured
lesser elementals must be controlled by the priest; otherwise, they
will simply assume a defensive posture until they return to their
native planes. Lesser elementals will not attack the priest when
uncontrolled. They may be controlled up to 30 yards away per
level of the caster. Lesser water elementals are destroyed if they are
more than 30 yards from a large body of water.
Create Smoke (Conjuration)
Sphere: Elemental Air or Fire
Range: 10 yards + 10 yards per level
Components: V, M
Duration: 4 rounds
Casting Time: 3 rounds
Area of Effect: 30 yard radius
Saving Throw: Special
Material Component: Flame
By igniting even a tiny spark of flame, the spell caster can create a
dense plume of smoke that will obscure vision for 30 yards and
cause all within range to run from the cloud to breathe. Any air
breathing creatures within the cloud must make a saving throw vs.
death magic. If a save fails, the victim must retreat from the cloud,
and coughing and rubbing his eyes. The victim fights at a 4
penalty for the next four rounds. Those who make their saving
throw, and are subject to the effects of the smoke may remain
within it, but they also fight at 4 for four rounds. Those who
make the save and leave the area suffer no ill effects. Friends and
foes alike are affected by the smoke. The reverse of the spell will
dissipate a generous amount of smoke for the same duration. This
allows a caster to peer into a burning building, but not through
mists or other visible gases.
Curse of Black Sand/Silt (Alteration)
Sphere: Elemental Earth or Silt
Range: 10 yards
Components: S
Duration: 1 day per level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Vs. spell
When this curse is cast and a save vs. spells fails, the victim leaves
black, oily, footprints in the earth or on silt. The prints are easily
tracked, and cannot be erased or destroyed until the spell expires.
They can be covered, but not by earth. A giant leaf, for example,
could hide a few footprints, but this would be a temporary fix at
best. If the victim flies or takes to the trees, he can avoid the spells
effects until he comes down again.
In silty areas, a black streak resembling a slow current will follow
the cursed character whenever he is in contact with the surface. This
includes wading, swimming, or walking on the top of the silt by spell
or magical devices. It would not affect those who flew or teleported.
Should a priest cast several of these spells on multiple targets,
he will be able to tell the various trails apart, even if they should
cross or overlap.
The trail disappears when the spell expires.
Heat Exhaustion (Summoning)
Sphere: Elemental Fire or Sun
Range: 50 yards
Components: V, S
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None.
Material Component: Sunlight
A beam of light streaks from the casters finger and slams into the
targets forehead, instantly causing the brain to overheat as if
struck by sunstroke or a fever. This causes momentary confusion
and delirium, and until the target is healed, all attack rolls and
saving throws are made at 2.
Cooling the victim dispels heat exhaustion, pouring a canteen
of water or cool liquid over the targets head is also effective. Dispel
magic, heal light wounds, and other healing spells also arrest
this condition.
Magma Jet (Invocation/Conjuration)
Sphere: Elemental Magma
Range: 2 yards per level
Components: V, S
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None
A priest casts this spell by simply pointing his finger at a target and
screaming the praises of the magma lords. A gout of sticky, molten
rock will gush and cover the victim in fiery goo. This causes 2d6
points of damage the first round and 1d6 points every round thereafter
until the magma is either cooled or removed, up to a period of
10 additional rounds. A body of water will cool magma in 2 rounds;
a canteen will not, but it will halt damage for one round. Ice spells or
resist fire are the most effective forms of protection.
A victim can drop and roll, extinguishing the magical flame in
1-4 rounds. If he rolls in loose sand or wet earth, the magma is
expunged in 1-2 rounds.
Oil Spray (Evocation/Conjuration)
Sphere: Elemental Earth
Range: 10 yards
Components: V, S
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 15 foot radius
Saving Throw: None
When a cleric casts this spell over rough earth or sand, fountains
of flammable oil spout up from the ground, covering everything
within a 15 foot radius.
The oil itself isnt particularly dangerous, though it will cause
the victims attacks and saves to suffer by 2. The real danger
occurs if the target is ignited. Burning oil causes 2d6 points of
damage in the first round, and 1d6 in the second. The victim
should also check his equipment each round to make sure that it
doesnt ignite. The oil burns off by the third round, and attack
and saving throw penalties are ignored.
If the oil isnt ignited, it will remain until removed by no less
than 3 turns of scrubbing or washing.
Sand Spray (Evocation/Summoning)
Sphere: Elemental Earth or Silt
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Cone 20 feet long x 10 feet wide
Saving Throw: Special
Material Component: A shard of glass, mica, quartz, or other
transparent substance.
This malicious evocation causes small glassy particles of sand or silt
to spray into an opponents eyes. The spell does not create the tiny
shards, so the caster must be on sand or silt for there to be any effect.
Anything sprayed by the slivers must make a saving throw vs.
breath weapons. Failure indicates that they are blinded for 1-6
rounds, and lose 1-10 hit points.
Sunblade (Conjuration)
Sphere: Elemental Sun
Range: 0
Components: V, M
Duration: I round per level
Casting Time: 4 round
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
Material Component: Sunlight
A brilliant sword of fiery sunlight appears in the casters hands
when this spell is cast. It acts as a magical long sword and grants a
+2 to attacks and damage. Blinding rays emanate from the flaming
blade, subtracting 1 from enemys attacks as long as the opponent
remains in melee. The sword does double damage to any
creatures with a weaknesses for sunlight or bright illumination.
4th-Level Spells
Acid Rain (Conjuration)
Sphere: Elemental Rain
Range: 120 yards
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 3 rounds
Area of Effect: 20 foot x 20 foot cube
Saving Throw: Vs. spell
This terrible enchantment creates a toxic shower that covers all
within its area of effect. The droplets are composed of very corrosive
acids, and eat through metal, cloth, and flesh. Anything
caught beneath the rain takes 2-12 points of damage. It is easy
enough to move out of the cube, but if a character cannot, he continues
to take 1-6 points of damage for each round spent in the
rain. A character who does not save must make saves for his
equipment as well.
Channel Flame (Evocation)
Sphere: Elemental Fire
Range: 30 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 5 rounds
Area of Effect: 10 foot x 10 foot cube
Saving Throw: None
Material Component: Special
When a priest casts this spell, he channels energy from burning
materials through himself, and can use it to attack his enemies.
When in range of 100 pounds or more of burning matter, he may
direct the flame to targets within a range of 30 yards. The flame
from the original source does not extinguish, it grows as it is fed
energy from the target. The damage from this attack is 1d4 points
for every level of the cleric.
A magical flame that fed off nothing would not fit the material
requirements of this spell, nor would a torch, but a burning cottage
would.
The spell remains in effect as long as the material component
remains alight, usually one turn.
Chimes of Finding (Enchantment)
Sphere: Elemental Air
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
Material Components: Wind chimes, map, personal item of the
target.
Missing and wanted persons can be located with the chimes of
finding ritual. This complicated spell requires a set of wind
chimes, a relatively detailed map of the area to be searched, a personal
item of the desired person, and a still, windless day.
The caster spreads the map out and suspends a set of normal
wind chimes above it; then he passes the point of his finger over
the map. When the chimes sound, he has pinpointed the location
he seeks. The better the map, the easier it is to find a person.
The chimes work even if the victim is dead, then, the chimes
toll more slowly, sadly. A Wisdom check allows the caster to
decide which sound is heard.
The spell does not work on inanimate objects.
Curse of the Choking Sands (Alteration)
Sphere: Elemental Water
Range: 3 yards
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 day per level
Casting Time: 4 round
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Vs. magic
Priests of water only use this spell against those that have truly
angered them, for it actually transforms good water into lifeless
sand.
When cast on a victim who fails a save vs. magic throw, the
victim is unable to drink water for a period of one week. When
he puts a container to his lips, the water inside turns to sand,
usually pouring down the unfortunate victims throat. If the victim
hasnt died from dehydration when the spell ends, he may
begin to drink normally. Of course, everything that had turned
to sand remains sand.
A dispel curse ends the spell prematurely. Overloading the
spell by completely immersing the cursed person under water,
also terminates this spell.
Defiler Scent (Divination)
Sphere: Elemental Air
Range: 10 yards per level
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 5 rounds
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None
Using this spell, priest can discern whether a particular being is
a defiler, although it will not tell him if the target is a spell caster.
A priest picks a target in an area of 10 yards for each level he
has attained. He concentrates for one round and waits as the
spiritual odors of the suspected defiler waft toward him. Preservers
and creatures by race and species smell normally.
Defilers carry the bitter scent of smoldering meat.
Healing Rays (Necromancy)
Sphere: Elemental Sun
Range: 30 yards
Components: V, S
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg (reverse only)
Material Component: Sunlight
This spell causes a beam of healing sunlight to caress the target,
healing 3-10 (d8+2) points of damage.
The reverse of the spell fires a beam of sunlight (radiation),
causing 1-10 points of damage.
Image of the Sorcerer-Kings (Alteration)
Sphere: Cosmos
Range: 1 yard
Components: S, M
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 1 suit of armor
Saving Throw: NA
Material Component: Templars sigil
This spell can only be used by templars. When a templars sigil is
presented and this spell is invoked, the priest is affected as if he
had cast the hand of the sorcerer-kings spell. The sigil is also
empowered with the ability to cause fear by touch for the duration
of the spell.
Infestation (Summoning)
Sphere: Elemental Earth
Range: 20 feet
Components: S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 6 rounds
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None
Material Component: A personal item of the target
This spell is similar to insect swarm except that it summons thousands
of tiny parasites from the surrounding area that take root in
the clothes, hair, and sometimes even the skin of the victim. The
target rarely knows a spell has been cast on him, so the horrible
effects of whatever parasites take hold are the first sign of the
spells success.
Cure spells greater than cure light wounds, heal, and remove
curse destroys the parasites instantly. If infestation is not removed
before destructive effects begin to affect the victim, he must be
treated for those as well. A person who lost his sight to eye mites,
for example, would need a cure blindness spell to restore his
vision.
This spell does not work against undead, ethereals, and any
other creatures that would be unaffected by parasitic infestation.
The material component can be any item that belongs to the
victim. It should be buried just beneath the earth as the spell is
cast, and can be dug up and reused anytime thereafter.
The spellcaster has no control over what kind of parasites are
summoned. Roll on the table provided below to determine parasitical
type.
It takes about 1 day before infestation sets in.
Roll
1d6 Results
1 Ear Mites: These microscopic creatures will cause permanent
deafness in 7-12 days (d6+6).
2 Eye Mites: Eye mites cause permanent blindness in 7-12
days (d6+6).
3 Desert Lice: Desert lice cause their host to feel generally
unhealthy, and any saving throws made vs. disease or poisons
are at 2. The lice may be removed by smothering
affected areas in oil or non-porous salves, or by magic.
4 Skin-Worms: These are the most dreaded parasitic organisms
in all the wastes of Athas. They live off of flesh and
secrete a toxic waste that slowly poison their hosts. Every
day after the third day of infection, a saving throw vs. poison
must be made. If it fails, death results in no more than
24 hours. Cure light wounds does not affect skin-worms,
but slow poison allows the victim to make a save for the day
the spell was cast. All other cure spells, and neutralize poison,
kill the parasites. A person always knows that he has
skin-worms, the tell-tale sores mark his flesh and cause
constant itching and pain.
5 Sand Fleas: While these tiny creatures arent deadly, they
are a source of constant itching and discomfort. Anyone
infected by sand fleas will cease to heal at the normal 1 hit
point a day rate, due to misery and discomfort. The victim
becomes cranky and irritable, resulting in a 3 on all
reaction rolls. Sand fleas notoriously leap from host to
host, almost like a contagious disease. Anyone traveling
with the victim should roll a save vs. breath weapons every
day. Failure indicates infestation.
6 Mind Worms: The Athasian mind worm is one of the
strangest insect creatures on any world. These tiny vermin
infest a victims hair and secrete a drug that excites certain
portions of the brain, causing hallucinations, delirium,
and hysteria. The host is always confused, as if by a feeblemind
spell, and often sees terrifying illusions of things
crawling over him or lurking just beyond the next sand
dune. The worms effects grow in time, so the first few hallucinations
are mild and probably undetectable by the
victims companions. Eventually, his condition deteriorates,
and it becomes obvious that he is suffering from
some mind altering ailment.. Normal healing spells kill
the bugs, so does shaving the head and scrubbing the
scalp.
Lungs of Water (Conjuration)
Sphere: Elemental Water
Range: 20 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Time of concentration
Casting Time: 4 rounds
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Vs. Spell
Material Component: Saliva
This spell magically creates water inside a victims lungs, drowning
them if they are not able to cough the stuff up. Nonbreathing
creatures and undead are not affected by this hex. Anyone who
fails a save vs. spells immediately begins to drown.
The spell can be stopped with remove curse or dispel magic, or by
disrupting the caster. A dehydrate spell will also cancel lungs of
water, and the victim suffers no other ill effects.
The material component is the casters saliva, spat at the
intended victim.
Magma Blade (Enchantment)
Sphere: Elemental Magma
Range: 0
Components: S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 5 rounds
Area of Effect: 1 weapon
Saving Throw: None
Material Component: An obsidian blade
When used on an obsidian sword, this spell sharpens the blade to
a razor edge and magically stores a burst of energy within. The
sword does +3 damage to anything it hits, and the impact releases
a store of magical heat that turns the sword into molten stone.
The sword bursts all over an opponent, covering him in burning
magma, and causing an additional 2-12 points of heat damage. It
can destroy equipment, and continues to burn for 1-6 points of
damage per round, up to 10 rounds. A body of water will cool the
magma in 2 rounds; a full canteen will not, but it will halt damage
for 1 round. Ice spells or resist fire are the most effective forms of
protection. Finally, the victim can drop and roll, extinguishing the
magma in 1-4 rounds. If he rolls in loose sand or wet earth, the
magma is expunged in 1-2 rounds.
To enchant a weapon, a priest must first forge or find an obsidian
blade. He takes the blade to a source of magma and, chanting
in an ancient language, plunges the sword into the lava. When it
emerges, the weapon is a magma blade. The sword is obviously
not reusable. Since this magma is destined to be wasted eventually,
the elemental plane will only allow any priest to have one
such weapon in existence at any given time. He does not have to
possess it, he just cannot make another until it has been used.
Magma Shield (Conjuration/Invocation)
Sphere: Elemental Magma
Range: Self
Components: V, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
Material Component: An ordinary shield
This spell forms a mystical, swirling mass of magma around a
common shield. The priest must be able to use a shield to cast
this spell, and it is destroyed when the spell ends.
Anyone in melee with the cleric will take 1-4 points of damage
if a saving throw vs. spells is not made each round. Any hits that
miss the caster by the shields armor class modifier of 1 are considered
to have hit the shield, and the weapon must make a saving
throw vs. acid or be destroyed.
Welders of the shield are protected from the intense heat it generates,
but not from any other heat source. The shield is reusable.
Mirage of Despair (Illusion)
Sphere: Elemental Sun
Range: 30 yards
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 hour per level
Casting Time: 4 rounds
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Vs. paralyzation
This spell is similar to create mirage, except that it affects a single
target. The victim sees everything in its worst possible lightfriends
are monsters, oases of beauty are deformed pools of black water.
Once a character has been affected by the mirage, he should
make a second saving throw vs. paralyzation. Failure means he is terrified
of the things he sees and flees as if under the 4th-level wizards
spell, fear. If the target makes the save, he attacks the closest target It
doesnt matter whether the target is friend or foeall are monstrous.
The reverse of the spell, mirage of deception, makes everything
seem beautiful, warm, and friendly. Athasian sloths are harmless
woodland creatures, and an ancient enemy is suddenly friendly
and trustworthy. As the victim becomes more trusting and
gullible, he will agree to any reasonable requests for the duration
of the spell. Requests of a dangerous or suicidal nature grant him
a second saving throw.
Either version of the spell affects only one creature of at least
medium intelligence. Companions who notice strange behavior
from a friend can try to talk him out of the mirage, and this gives
the victim one additional saving throw. Dispel magic or reversing
the spell ends the illusion.
Return to the Earth (Necromancy)
Sphere: Elemental Earth
Range: 0
Components: V, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 3 rounds
Area of Effect: 3 inch radius per level
Saving Throw: None
This spell turns a dead body into dust. Corpses inhabited by
spirits, such as wights or liches, are allowed a save, but zombies,
skeletons, and other undead are not. Once cast, bits of the
undead begin to crumble and fall to the ground, completely
destroying it in 3 rounds. To represent their deterioration,
undead suffer a cumulative 1 to attack, each round after the
spell has taken affect.
The undead must actually have a physical form, ghosts and
ghasts would not be subject to this spell.
Sand Warriors (Conjuration/Enchantment)
Sphere: Elemental Earth or Silt
Range: 30 yards
Components: S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: NA
Material Component: A cup of water
The conjurer can summon 1d4 warriors from beneath the sand to
fight in his stead. The warriors are completely loyal and cannot be
controlled or stolen, although they can be banished by dispel
magic. They have an armor class of 5, 2 Hit Dice, and wield terrible
swords of compressed, fine sand that cause 1-10 points of damage
whenever they hit THAC0 is 18, and movement is 150 feet. The
sand warriors take double damage from water based attacks. To use
this spell, a cup of water poured onto the sand where the warriors
are to rise.
Soothe (Invocation)
Sphere: Elemental Water or Rain
Range: 0
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 round per 2 levels
Casting Time: 5 rounds
Area of Effect: 10 foot radius
Saving Throw: None
The caster claps his hands together, making the sound of thunder,
and rain begins to fall in a 10 foot radius. Every creature beneath
the cloud regains 1 hit point per round, up to the duration of the
spell. The rain also causes a 1 penalty to all melee attacks within
its area of effect.
Stone of Sharpening (Alteration)
Sphere: Elemental Earth
Range: 0
Components: S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 5 rounds
Area of Effect: 1 weapon per level
Saving Throw: NA
Material Components: Oil, cloth
The caster wraps a cloth around a stone no more than 2 feet in
diameter, and soaks it with oil. He sets the cloth on fire and allows
it to burn until it disintegrates. Once this is done, any sword or
edged weapon struck against the rock have its edge perfectly
sharpen and oiled, giving it a +3 damage to the next target it hits,
+2 to the second, and +1 to the third. There are no special effects
after the third blow has been struck. The stone will sharpen as
many weapons as the level of the caster. It works on metal, obsidian,
and bone.
Thorns of Binding (Alteration)
Sphere: Elemental Earth or Water
Range: 10 yards
Components: S
Duration: 1 turn +1 turn per level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 10 yards per level
Saving Throw: Vs. spell
By casting this spell, the priest causes a magical rope of thorns to
appear and wrap itself around an opponent. Failing a save results
in 1d4 points of damage, added to the armor class of the victim.
To escape the bonds, a character must make a saving throw vs.
spells at 4. This is an attempt to escape, and the victim takes
another 1d4 + AC for every attempt, whether or not he is successful.
Water Trap (Alteration)
Sphere: Elemental Water or Rain
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 hour per level
Casting Time: 5 rounds
Area of Effect: 20 foot diameter
Saving Throw: Special
Material Component: Special
With a water trap spell, the caster turns a normal body of water, no
more than 20 feet in diameter, into a deathtrap. The spell magnifies
the natural surface tension of the water, giving it the strength
to pull size M and smaller creatures to a murky death. Whenever
a creature of affected size attempts to drink from a pool, oasis, or
watering hole altered by this spell, it must make an immediate saving
throw vs. death magic. Failure indicates that the victim is
instantly pulled under the surface and trapped.
Creatures pulled under by this spell will find that the surface of
the water now has a tough, rubbery consistency (at least from below)
that makes escape very difficult. A trapped creature may escape by
attempting a second save at a 6 penalty.
Friendly creatures outside the pool add +1 to the victims save
every round, and are in no danger of being sucked under themselves
once the trap has been sprung. Beings of size L and larger
may free one trapped creature per round.
This spell is most often used to trap desert oases and private
wells. Its material component is a small wooden or stone figure of
a man trapped in a hardened bit of amber or other translucent
stone.
Whirlpool of Doom (Evocation)
Sphere: Elemental Earth or Silt
Range: 10 yards per level
Component: V, S
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 5 rounds
Area of Effect: 5 foot radius per level
Saving Throw: Vs. Spell
This terrible spell turns earth or silt into a swirling sea of rock and
earth. Anyone standing in the area must make a save vs. spells.
Failure indicates that they have been sucked into the center of the
whirlpool and must begin to make swimming proficiency checks
at a +3 penalty. Creatures that make three successful checks in a
row are able to make their way to the edge of the pool and pull
themselves free. Failing a proficiency check means that the character
begins to drown.
5th-Level Spells
Crumble (Alteration)
Sphere: Elemental Earth or Water
Range: 10 yards per level
Components: S, V
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 5 round
Area of Effect: 1 item of 1 cubic foot per level
Saving Throw: None
Crumble instantly reduces an inanimate objects water content to
zero. Up to one cubic foot of clay, rock, soil, or other solids per level of
the caster can be desiccated to the point that they lose cohesion,
crack, and crumble. A 7th-level priest could affect 7 swords, or a
stone of no more than 7 cubic feet.
Nonliving organic materials such as hide, leather, bone, and
wood split and crumble into dust when affected by this spell. Liquids
disappear instantly and fruit-potions turn to withered husks.
Metals and living organic material and silicates such as glass are
entirely unaffected. Mindless corporeal undead like zombies and
skeletons take 1d6 points of damage for every 3 levels of the caster.
Flame Harvest (Conjuration/Invocation)
Sphere: Elemental Fire
Range: Special
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 1 hour
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: 1/2
Material Component: Priests holy symbol
This powerful spell creates a trap of a large field, copse of wood, or
other flammable area, triggered by certain, predefined conditions.
The priest slowly walks the area to be trapped for a period of an
hour, envisioning the rising flames and deciding on the conditions
that will trigger its activation. When the meditation period
ends, the priest may leave the area and the trap remains set for 1
month.
The PC who cast the spell must write the conditions of his
spell on paper for the DM, and the DM should take his words as
literally as possible. The conditions may be as simple or as complex
as the player likes, but they must be written. Some possible
conditions are: whenever anyone steps foot in this grove, or, whenever
templars draw their weapons.
When the condition is met, the area is engulfed in flames, and
everyone inside takes 6d8 points of damage.
The area affected is 30 square feet, but the shape of the area
does not affect the spell in any way.
The site will continue to burn normally, and anyone trapped
takes 1d4 points of damage until the fire burns itself out.
6th-Level Spells
Heartseeker (Enchantment)
Sphere: Elemental Earth or Water
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 6 hours
Casting Time: 15 minutes
Area of Effect: 1 item
Saving Throw: Special
This terrible spell is cast on a piercing weapon, a spear or an
arrow. When the point of the weapon penetrates human flesh
(causes damage), the wooden tip will begin to sprout as if growing.
The roots and branches seek out vital organs as a source of nutrients.
If a saving throw vs. death magic isnt made, the vines burst
through the victims vital organs, killing him instantly. If the save is
made, the target manages to pull the weapon out but takes an
additional 1-8 points of damage.
This does not work on undead or creatures without internal
organs.
Mark of the Hunted (Summoning)
Sphere: Elemental Air
Range: 30 yards
Components: S, M
Duration: 1 day per level
Casting Time: 2 rounds
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None
This curse summons a dreadful beast from the surrounding vicinity
and marks the victim for its prey. Whenever this spell is cast,
the DM should pick the foulest creature he can find. The mon-
ster should be the most powerful beast found in that area. It can
not be an ethereal, undead, nor a creature that does not eat meat.
Nightmare beasts, megapedes, and wild beasts are the most commonly
attracted creatures.
Whatever the animal, it believes the victim to be the sweetest
meat it has ever smelled, and begins to follow 1-4 hours after the
spell is cast. From that point until the expiration of the spell, the
beast will pursue the victim and will not be able to rest until it eats
him or it is slain.
When the spell has expired, the creature returns to its lair, unless
it is still in sight of the target. If that is the case, the thing will continue
to pursue the character until it loses him.
Sand Blade (Enchantment)
Sphere: Elemental Earth or Silt
Range: 0
Components: S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 1 day
Area of Effect: 1 sword
Saving Throw: NA
Material Component: Crystal or glass sword
This spell requires a sword made of a crystalline stone (such as
quartz) or glass. The weapon must be of the highest quality and
craftsmanship, and forged without aid of magic or psionics.
The enchantment of the sword takes an entire day, and at days
end the caster must make an unmodified saving throw vs. spells.
Failure indicates that the blade must be enchanted for another
day and another save vs. spells required, now at 1. The caster is
permitted a number of attempts equal to 1/4 his level (round
down.) Each additional attempt is made at a cumulative 1
penalty. If the save is made, the sword has been enchanted. If all
fail, the sword is ruined and can never be used for this spell
again.
A successfully enchanted sand blade is razor-sharp, inflicting
+2 damage to opponents. It has no attack bonus, and cannot
affect creatures immune to ordinary weapons. It is very difficult to
see, and is effectively invisible in dim light, from a distance, or
underwater. Sand blades are also completely invisible to magic
that detects metal and minerals.
If a wielder rolls an unmodified 1 while using the sword
against an armored target (chitin, metal, bone armor, or skin), it
splinters into thousands of deadly shards. The damage from the
blow is doubled due to the spray of glass, but the sword is shattered
and now forever useless.
Spirit of Flame (Evocation)
Sphere: Elemental Fire
Range: 2 miles/level
Components: V, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 6 rounds
Saving Throw: None
With this spell, a priest can walk into a fire and teleport to any
other up to the limit of his range. The priest may go blindly, and
will appear in a random camp fire in a place determined by the
DM. If the caster isnt near a settlement, there is 30% chance there
will be no camp fire and the spell is wasted. A better course is to
cast watchfire and see. The destructive fire elementals demand a
high price for this spell, and the priest must sacrifice 1-6 hit points
every time he uses it. The damage heals normally.
Sunstroke (Summoning)
Sphere: Elemental Sun
Range: 10 yards/level
Components: M, V
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 6 rounds
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Vs. magic
The caster points his finger at a target and a brilliant beam of sunlight
shoots outward to cause a severe case of heat exhaustion.
The victim must make a saving throw vs. magic or instantly collapse
into a convulsive mass until treated or dead. Those who
make the save are affected as if the target of the 3rd-level heat
exhaustion spell.
The targets skin becomes cold and clammy, he does not sweat
regardless of the heat, and his muscles convulse dangerously. This
causes him to lose 1-4 hit points per round. The condition can be
stopped by a heal or cure critical wounds spell, or by pouring at
least one gallon of cool water over the victims head.
Once a character has suffered a severe heat stroke, he is forever susceptible.
Those affected require twice their normal amounts of water
if exposed to the sun for more than four hours, and may go into convulsions
if not adequately hydrated.
Transmute Rock to Magma (Alteration)
Sphere: Elemental Magma
Range: 10 yards per level
Components: V, S
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 2 rounds
Area of Effect: 5 cube per level
Saving Throw: Vs. paralyzation
This spell turns a patch of rock or solid earth into fiery magma by
superheating it in a matter of seconds. Anything caught within the
area should make a saving throw vs. paralyzation or take 6d8 points
of damage. The magma will remain for about 2 days, and then cool
to a black circle of ash.
The reverse of this spell is only of temporary duration. It transforms
magma to stone cool enough to walk on for one hour.
Watchfire (Divination)
Sphere: Elemental Fire
Range: 2 miles per level
Components: V, M
Duration: 1 hour
Casting Time: 3 rounds
Area of Effect: 1 fire at a time
Saving Throw: NA
Material Component: A small campfire
This powerful spell allows a caster to know how many fires burn
within the area of effect and the approximate location of each. He
may choose any one of these fires and peer out of it as if he were
actually within the flames. Anyone watching the fire sees a dark
face peering out at them, but can only dispel the visage by extinguishing
the flame or casting other protections from scrying.
The caster may communicate through the flames, but he may
not cast spells or use special abilities.
The reverse of this spell protects all fires in range from being
used in this way.
Waters of Life (Alteration)
Sphere: Elemental Water
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 3 rounds
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: NA
Material Component: Herbs
This powerful spell is representative of the life-giving nature of
water, and the sacrifices that the priests of that sphere are willing
to make for those they believe worthy.
The priest spends makes an elixir from local herbs. Once
made, the priest gives half the potion to the patient, and takes the
rest himself.
The former patient is now healed of all damage, poisons, or diseases,
but the effects, wounds, and other symptoms are transferred
to the priest.
Soon the healer falls into a near comatose state for a period of
two hours while his body fights off infections and repairs the
damage.
At the end of this period, the priest should make a system
shock roll. If he passes the test, he awakens from the coma and
all is well. If he fails, he suffers the effects of whatever was wrong
with the former patient. This cannot result in the priests death.
Conditions that would cause his death are halted, and the priest
goes into a trance for another 24 hours. When he awakes, he will
have only 1 hit point, but no other ill effects, scars, or contagion.
If friendly spell-casting heals the damage, the priest quickly
recovers from his coma, losing 1-4 hit points representing
fatigue.
Magical afflictions, diseases, or curses cannot be cured by the
waters of life.
Wisdom of the Sorcerer-Kings (Summoning)
Sphere: Cosmos
Range: Special
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Self
Saving Throw: NA
This frequently used summons allows a templar to pick any spell
he needs from the templar spell list. The character casts wisdom,
and then picks another spell of levels 1-5 to be cast in the following
round. The spell he chooses must be casthe may not cancel
activation, although he may shorten the duration of a spell.
Finally, he may not cast more than one spell.
This useful spell is representative of the sorcerer-kings raw
power, and the fact that he can channel spell energies directly to
his followers.
7th-Level Spells
Bane of the Defilers (Necromancy)
Sphere: Cosmos
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 day
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: NA
Material Component: A bone from a defilers corpse
This spell turns an ordinary missile weapon of wood, metal, or
stone into a deadly projectile of defiler slaying, adding +3 to
attack and double damage to defilers.
Create Shrine (Invocation)
Sphere: Elemental (All)
Range: Special
Components: S, V, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 3 months
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: NA
Material Component: Special
When a cleric finds a power conjunction he wants to protect from
others, he will often begin the magical process of turning it into an
elemental shrine.
The entire process takes about 3 months and requires a substantial
investment of time and energy.
The first requirement of the spell is to find a natural area where
the clerics patron element is strong.
Shrines of rain must be in special places where natural rainfall
is common. Sun clerics may build their shrines on high mountains.
Shrines to the lords of fire require more effort. First, the
priest must create an eternal flame. Atop this fire, the priest must
place an item of great value to himself. When the blaze finally
dies to the size of a campfire, the cleric begins the create shrine
spell, and the flame burns forever. The item is sacrificed to the
lords of fire and destroyed in the conflagration.
Once the area has been prepared and any threats removed from
it, the cleric sits and meditates on the nature of his element. He
must continue to do this for at least eight hours every day for the
next three months. Any time missed cancels the spell, and the
cleric must begin again from scratch.
When three months have passed, the shrine grants the caster a
number of phantom hit points equal to 12 times the casters
level. These are good only while the cleric is actually at the shrine,
and can only be used to absorb damage from defiling magic.
The cleric who created the spell has one other special advantage.
While on the grounds of the shrine, he may exercise his
ability to ignore the elements an unlimited number of times per
day. The power continues even if the priest leaves the shrine, but
then it expires normally. This counts as a use for that day, so he
cannot exploit this ability again, unless he moves back to the
shrine.
There is no limit to the number of clerics that can benefit from
being at a shrine, and none may be affected by spells of that element
while there.
The cleric is under no obligation to remain at the shrine after it
is created, but many do, insuring its protection.
Dehydrate (Evocation)
Sphere: Elemental Sun or Water
Range: 5 yards per level
Components: V, S
Duration: Time of concentration
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None
This awful spell causes water to evaporate rapidly from the targets
body. The victim loses 1 hit point per round as his body fluids seep
to the surface of the skin and are absorbed by the spell. This continues
until either the subject is dead or the spell caster is disrupted.
Drinking a canteen of water will stop all damage for 4 rounds and
heal 1-4 points of damage. The spell not only steals its victims
water, it transfers it to the caster as well. The priest will not have to
drink again for a number of days equal to 10% of the stolen hit
points. If 20 hit points were stolen, the priest does not have to drink
for 2 days.
If the victim survives, healing spells work normally, and drinking
good water returns all but 1-6 of the lost hit points.
Eruption (Invocation)
Sphere: Elemental Magma
Range: 10 yards per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 2 rounds
Area of Effect: 30 inch diameter
Saving Throw: 1/2
This spell causes an area around the target to erupt into geysers of
molten rock. Columns of fiery stone burst from the ground and
spew deadly lava over everything within the radius of the spell.
Creatures within the area must attempt to move out (unless protected
from fire or heat) and take 3d8 points of damage every
round they are outside this area. The molten rock sticks to skin
and continues burning, so damage continues at 1d8 points per
round until cooled or until 10 rounds have passed.
Glass Storm (Evocation/Summoning)
Sphere: Elemental Earth or Silt
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: 30 foot radius
Saving Throw: None
Material Component: Shard of glass or crystal
This powerful version of the glass spray spell not only lifts and
separates tiny crystal shards from sand or silt, it creates a terrible
wind to propel them. The particles whip about the storms area,
leaving a circular 5 foot eye where the caster and his companions
may stand unharmed.
The storm is very rough on leather armor, flesh, and other soft
targets. Any equipment must make a saving throw vs. fire or
become useless. Living creatures (and undead) take 2d8 points of
damage per round until they leave the path of the storm.
Missile combat is impossible in the spells area of effect. Everyone
inside the area is blinded and confused, and the DM should
randomly determine which direction a character is facing when
he tries to escape.
Initiation (Invocation)
Sphere: Elemental (All)
Range: Special
Components: V
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 12 hours
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: NA
This is the spell used to protect a student from the element allied
with the caster, and to open a link between him and the beings he
will serve. Each elemental initiation has its own requirements,
and details are discussed in Chapters Two and Three.
Rumors abound that if an applicant is being protected by this
spell and his mentor dies, a terrible new undead creature is created.
No one has ever proven it, but if this is true, the thing would
be a horror, a ghastly fusion of the ruined remnants of the student
and the element he sought to serve.
Magma Tunnel (Alteration)
Sphere: Elemental Magma
Range: 0
Components: S, M
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 1 turn + 1 turn per level
Area of Effect: 30 foot by 10 foot, cylinder
Saving Throw: NA
Material Component: A torch
By using this spell, a priest can tunnel through solid earth or rock,
but not sand or silt, by turning it into flowing magma. The liquid
rock moves out of the way to allow the caster to pass, and hardens
in that position, creating a permanent tunnel. Dispel magic has
no effect once the tunnel is formed. It takes about 24 hours for the
heat to dissipate enough for the unprotected to enter, although
the caster is protected for the duration of the spell. The priests
movement rate is 3 while in the tunnel.
The torch is applied to the spot of earth the priest wishes to
melt. The torch does no damage to living material, but armor,
rock, weapons, and material objects must save vs. fire to survive.
Scirocco (Evocation)
Sphere: Elemental Air or Silt
Range: 10 yards per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1-6 turns
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 10 feet per level
Saving Throw: Special
Material Components: A leather fan and a grindstone chip
With this spell, a caster summons up a scirocco, the burning
desert wind of legend. The caster must be able to see the sky to
cast this spell, and he must be in an area covered with sand or
loose stone. Calling up a Scirocco is dangerous, because the
priest can not control it once it is summoned.
At the end of the round in which the spell is cast, a blast of
scorching wind emanates from the caster and sweeps along the
ground before him, whipping up small objects and particulate
matter, and carrying them along at tremendous speed. Creatures
of size L and smaller must make a saving throw vs. petrifaction at
4 or is bowled over by the force of the wind, and spends both the
current round and the next one in the scirocco attempting to
stand. All items caught in the storm (including metal) are
abraded by flying grit and must save vs. acid or be destroyed. Magical
items save with their bonuses added to the basic roll. Living
creatures suffer 2d10 points of damage per round of exposure.
The only way to escape a scirocco is to move outside its area of
effect. Ground movement rates for all creatures inside are
reduced to 10% of normal; all other movement (except innate
teleportation or planar travel) is impossible. Killing the caster or
rendering him unconscious will not end the spell, and he cannot
end it prematurely even if he wishes. The caster is not bound to
remain in place after the spell has been cast, but he may not cast
other spells until the scirocco has run its course or been dispelled.
Once the scirocco has started, it will begin to drift in a random
direction every round. Each round, select a direction to be 12 o
clock, and roll a d12. The number indicates the position the
Scirocco will move into for 2d10 yards.
The range of the spell is dependent upon the casters level, and
he may have the storms center appear at any point up to the limit
of that range. He is not immune to its effects.
Wild Lands (Alteration/Necromancy)
Sphere: Cosmos
Range: 0
Components: M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 4 hours
Area of Effect: 1/2 mile per level
Saving Throw: NA
This spell transforms an area into a wild place that attracts monsters
and savage peoples. Druids frequently use it to protect
guarded lands, and priests use it to shield rare power conjunctions
and shrines. Templars cannot use the wild lands spell.
The priest focuses the spell on an inanimate object, a rock or a
statue, and it becomes the focal point of the spell. Violent creatures
will slowly gravitate to the spotusually a new creature
appears every two weeks. Roll on the random encounter table for
the appropriate terrain type. If a passive creature is generated, roll
again. Neutral creatures are possible, but they should be wild and
dangerous. Intelligent creatures such as humans, gith, or thrikreen
will be savage and war-like. They are not necessarily evil,
just fiercely protective, proud, and belligerent.
The only way to dispel the wild lands is to destroy the item that
serves as its focus. It is not protected by the spell, but casters often
trap the object with other spells.
